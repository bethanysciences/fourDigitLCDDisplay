fourDigitLCDDisplay
===================

Arduino library to use a 7 segment 4 digit LCD Display

This code can be used to display numbers on a 7x4 Display like this https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11407.
For the right pins see pins.png.

This pins layout will fit the LCD above but it can be easily changed the code.

To connect the digit pins you may want to use a resistor (e.g. 1k). It will work (for a short time) without but then it will burn out your segments.
